	Abstract = {An artificial neural network (ANN) is a type of artificial intelligence technology which implements more complex data-analysis features into existing applications by an intelligent, human-like application of knowledge. ANN can be considered as a mathematical or computational model based on biological (brain) neural networks. ANN is an adaptive system that changes its structure based on external or internal information that is processed within the network during the learning stage. ANNs implement algorithms that attempt to achieve neurologically-related processes and performances such as learning from experience, making generalizations from similar situations and judging states where poor results were achieved in the past. This new and important book gathers the most current research from across the globe in the study of artificial neural networks},
