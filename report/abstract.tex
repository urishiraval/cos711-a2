The purpose of this report is to demonstrate the performance implications of Passive training methods with a focus on Simple Gradient Decent and Newtonian Gradient Methods (specifically Conjugate Gradient Decent) in contrast with Curriculum Learning. The findings from the variuous documented experiments, using the Sloan Digital Sky Survay data, indicate that while both Curriculum Learning and 'Augmented' Passive learning display subtle improvements to the ratio of Neural Network Accuracy vs Training 'Costs', Curriculum Learning may be a more robust solution despite being more prone to erroneous implementation.
